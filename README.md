  a quiet space where science meets systems.  
  building, researching, and writing â€” slowly, intentionally.

### ðŸ§¬ who i am  
iâ€™m darshika pasi â€” a biotech undergrad trying to understand cancer, code, and everything they donâ€™t teach you in class.  
my work lives at the edge of wet lab dreams and dry lab tools.  
i explore biology not just in textbooks, but in molecules, datasets, and the questions that haunt both.

---

### ðŸ”­ what i'm working on
- exploring how **breast cancer and t2dm** interact at the molecular level  
- building [**Refracto**](https://refracto.vercel.app) â€” a research assistant built for focus  
- writing a review on **omics-based breast cancer therapeutics**  
- drafting original research on **plant-based dual modulators**  
- learning bioinformatics like itâ€™s my second language

---

### ðŸ”¬ research, to me...
- is a way of seeing  
- is iterative, like code  
- begins in curiosity, ends in clarity  
- doesnâ€™t need a lab to be real  
- is a habit, not a goal

### ðŸ“Œ little things

ðŸŒ± currently learning:  
â†’ deeper layers of bioinformatics, streamlit, next.js  
â†’ how to think in systems, not just steps

ðŸ‘¯ looking to collaborate on:  
â†’ bio + tech ideas, research tooling, writing pieces  
â†’ anything that asks good questions

ðŸ’¬ ask me about:  
â†’ refracto, breast cancer research, paper writing, science workflows  
â†’ or just how to get started in all this â€” slowly
